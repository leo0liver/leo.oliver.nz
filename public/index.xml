      <description>Once you are far down the path of using emacs and org-mode, it feels wasteful to learn a whole new scheme for generating text. As much as I love markdown, I would much rather put my muscle memory to use keeping my content in org-mode files. This thinking took me to the excellent org-mode extension ox-hugo. This module allows you to keep your content in a monolithic org file and simply exports neatly to the markdown that hugo expects.</description>

      <description>heading Hi.
{.command-line} $ ls dir1 dir2 file1 file2 ... here is code (out) test feroxbuster -u test.com I&amp;rsquo;m Rohit Goswami, better known across the web as HaoZeke. I&amp;rsquo;m not the first of my name, which is why instead of rgoswami, I occasionally use rg0swami when I need to be identified by something closer to my name.
The actual username is a throwback to back when people liked being anonymous (and with multiple personalities) online, so that ought to give an idea of how old I am.</description>
